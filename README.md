This example demonstrates an uncommon Perl bug related to hash iteration order. Perl hashes do not guarantee any particular order of iteration. The provided code iterates through a hash, and the output order of key-value pairs may vary depending on the Perl interpreter and its internal hash implementation.  This can lead to unexpected results if code relies on a specific iteration order.
